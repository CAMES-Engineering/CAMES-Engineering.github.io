Kommunikationscentret (KCX) Region Hovedstaden is a Center for Communication Disorders, a public organization offering services available to all citizens with a specialized communication need.  
The communication center KCX contacted CAMES with a problem regarding a "shield" they used to put over their keyboards. They did this to help their clients with motor disability in their fingers.
Previously, KCX contacted another company which had a very high price per unit. This resulted that some municipalities could not afford to buy for every client who needed the "shield" as it was too expensive to purchase.

The shield is a plate that is placed over the keyboard to separate each individual button so that the user does not mistakenly press several keys at the same time.

Our task was to design a new model that could be easily clicked on and off, with a lower cost, so that more people would be able to use them. CAMES has extensive experience with 3D printing and saw the possibility of being able to adapt each individual shield without the large costs for the user. In addition, it would be possible to help more clients to have an easier everyday life without writing difficulties.

The keyboard is designed so that it is possible to "click" the shield on from the top. In this way, it is easy for the user to take the shield off and on if this is necessary. In addition, you will be able to quickly order a new shield if you want a different color or the first shield is lost, and you will be able to have a new 3D printed shield within 12 hours.

Right now we have designed two different keyboards. A Logic Keyboard which is a regular stationary keyboard, and a Cherry Keyboard which is slightly smaller and will be easier to take with you on the go.

The Logic Keyboard can be found via this link [logic keyboard](https://cames-engineering.github.io/posts/logickeyboard/).
