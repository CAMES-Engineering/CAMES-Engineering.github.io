This repository contains a STL file of a mold for casting caps for blood pressure monitor. The caps prevent water from entering the cuff when washing.  
The cap fits Philips blood pressure monitors both mobile and stationary.  
The blood pressure monitor cuffs are reusable, but needs to be cleaned. The caps are placed on the tube so water can not enter the cuffs.

**Printing the molds**: Print the STL file (silicone_propper.stl) directly on a 3D printer in PLA to create the mold.   

**Casting**: For casting the caps smooth-on Dragon Skin 20 silicone is used. The silicone is a two compound silicone with a mixing ration of 1:1 in either volume or weight.
- ?? gr part A Dragon Skin 29
- ?? gr part B Dragon Skin 29

You can add coloring to the mixture if desired. Mix the two silicone components. Pour the silicone into the mold and fill it up.   
Let it cure for 5 hours. Remove the cured silicone from the mold. Separate the caps by cutting them and you will have 36 caps.
