When performing a peripheral venous catheter (PVC), it can sometimes be difficult due to anatomical challenges. One of the solutions to this is using a ultrasound guided PVC, which is more versatile and has a higher succesrate. To learn the procedure a good training course and practical phantom is needed.  
The phantom is made of ballisticgel and has three vessels, a 6 mm straight, a 3 mm straight, and a 6 mm bending vessel. It has a flat surface with a round top to emulate the lower part of the arm. It comes in three types, a transparent, a semi-transparant with enhanced echogenicity and one with is fully colored also with enhanced echogenicity.  
It is produced by heating an oven to 90-120 degrees celsius, then by using a custom made metal mould add three metal rods where the vessel is suppose to be and fill the rest of the mould with ballistic gel. When the ballisticgel is fluent add coloring and echogenicity powder and stur the mixture. When most of the airbubbles are gone and the mass is homogeneous the oven can be turned off and let the phantom rest overnight. When it has rested carefully pull out the phantom and remove the metal rods. Fill up the vessels with water and plug the holes and use some gel to properly see the phantom.
