*This project in finished and can be ordered from [CAMES Engineering](https://cames.dk/services/3d-print/).*  

Performing 4D scannings of the respiratory system a gating block is necessary. The gating block need to be perfectly leveled for the software to detect it. Levelling the gating block is difficult on the human body (chest) since it is uneven. To assists levelling the gating block a wedge is used. The wedges are expensive and often gets lost during the busy days at the hospitals. To solve this problem a wedge is made. The wedge can easily be printed and has lower costs.  

**Printing the wedge**: Print the STL file (Kile v1.stl) directly on a 3D printer in PLA.   

The wedge can be used after the print has finished.
