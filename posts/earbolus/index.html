See the project at <a href=https://cames.dk/services/3d-print/>CAMES Engineering</a></em></p><p>When treating superficial cancer using radiation therapy a bolus is needed. The bolus is a tissue-equivalent material that increases the skin dose to target cancer cells better. The commercial bolus used at the hospital is flat sheets that do not fit the contours of a human ear and creates air gaps between the bolus and the ear. The bolus sheet is cut in the desired size and has different predetermined thicknesses available. The bolus is afterwards stacked on top of each other to create the desired thickness but is still limited to the predefined thicknesses. The air gaps between the patient and the bolus result in incoherence between the planned and delivered dose. The predefined thicknesses result in physicians compromising on the optimal bolus thickness for treatment.<br>The product is a patient-specific ear bolus. The bolus is made from a 3D scanning of the patient’s ear. The 3D scanning is obtained using a Structure Sensor Pro camera attached to an iPad. The patient is scanned during the pre-check-up where the physician plans the radiation treatment. The physician orders the bolus by specifying the desired thickness and area. The engineers will then process the 3D scan to create a mold of the patient’s ear. The mold will be personalized with the thickness ordered by the physician and social security number. The mold will be printed using a 3D printer at CAMES engineering. When the mold has been printed, the bolus is cast using silicone.<br>The finished bolus is delivered at the clinic and can be used and reused for the patient.<br>The bolus is made from a 3D scan, so air gaps between the bolus and the patient are highly reduced or even eliminated. This will ensure better coherence between planned and delivered doses. The physicians can order the bolus in the desired thickness meaning the thickness is not being compromised by predefined thicknesses. This ensures that fewer healthy cells are targeted, and the depth of treatment can be controlled easily. The patient-specific bolus is also expected to spare time during treatment because of not needing to fit bolus material as much. The patient-specific bolus can be placed directly on the patient’s ear and treatment can begin.
The patient-specific bolus will better and more accurate treatment of patients suffering from skin lymphomas and spare time during treatment by not having to fit the bolus.</p><p><figure><img src=/img/earbolus/moldfront.jpg><figcaption><h4></h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/img/earbolus/moldside.jpg><figcaption><h4></h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/img/earbolus/bolusfront.jpg><figcaption><h4></h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/img/earbolus/bolusside.jpg><figcaption><h4></h4></figcaption></figure></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://cames-engineering.github.io/js/jquery.min.js></script>
