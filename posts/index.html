To prevent transferring bacteria between patients it is important the cuffs are cleaned. Buying the cuffs a cap is received, but the caps easily get lost. It is not possible to buy new caps from the company without buying a new cuff as well. We made caps that prevent water from entering the cuff when washing and can be made easily and in big quantities.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3 masonry-item"><div class=box-masonry><a href=https://cames-engineering.github.io/posts/earbolus/ title class="box-masonry-image with-hover-overlay"><img src=https://cames-engineering.github.io/img/earbolus/moldfront.jpg alt class=img-responsive></a><div class=box-masonry-hover-text-header><h4><a href=https://cames-engineering.github.io/posts/earbolus/>Patient specific bolus</a></h4><div class=box-masonry-description><p>When treating superficial cancer using radiation therapy a bolus is needed.
